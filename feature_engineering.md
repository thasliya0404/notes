## Feature Engineering

* Definition: Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract and transform raw data into features that make machine learning algorithms work effectively.
It involves selecting, modifying, or creating new features from the existing data to improve the performance of a model.

## Key Concepts:

* Feature: A variable or attribute in the dataset that the model will use to make predictions.
* Engineering: The process of refining, transforming, and creating features to better represent the underlying data and patterns.
