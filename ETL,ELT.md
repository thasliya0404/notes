# ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

* Definition: Traditional data integration process where data is extracted from multiple sources, transformed into a proper format/structure, and then loaded into a target system (like a data warehouse).

## Steps:

* Extract
Pull data from heterogeneous sources (databases, APIs, files, sensors, etc.). Ensures raw data collection.
* Transform
Clean, standardize, filter, aggregate, and apply business rules. Data is transformed before loading.
* Load
Store the transformed data into the target system (usually a data warehouse).

## Characteristics:

* Data is cleaned & standardized before loading.
* Transformation happens in a staging area.
* Used when data quality and business rules are critical.
* More resource-heavy on the ETL tool or middleware.

## Example Tools:
* Informatica, Talend, Pentaho, IBM DataStage, SSIS.

# ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)

* Definition: Modern approach where data is extracted from sources, directly loaded into the target system (often a cloud-based data lake/warehouse), and then transformations are applied within the warehouse.

## Steps:

* Extract
Data pulled from sources.
* Load
Load raw data directly into the target system.
* Transform
Transformations are executed inside the data warehouse using its processing power (e.g., SQL, cloud services).

## Characteristics:

* Data is loaded in raw form first, transformations later.
* Efficient when using cloud warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).
* Better scalability for big data.
* Shifts workload to the target system (which is usually highly optimized).

## Example Tools:
* Fivetran, Stitch, Airbyte, dbt (for transformations).

## When to Use

## ETL
* On-premises warehouses.
* Data requires strict cleaning before storage.
* Legacy systems.

## ELT

* Cloud-native architectures.
* Huge datasets (IoT, clickstream, logs).
* When storage is cheap, and compute is scalable.
