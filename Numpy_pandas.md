# NumPy

* Python library used for working with arrays.
* NumPy stands for NUMerical PYthon.
* Used for multidimensional array operations.
* Various other libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn are built on top of this amazing library.
* NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant.
* An open source project and you can use it freely.
* Used for applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
## import numpy as np

## Arrays

* Arrays are a collection of elements/values, that can have one or more dimensions.
* An array of one dimension is called a Vector while having two dimensions is called a Matrix.
* NumPy arrays are called ndarray or N-dimensional arrays and they store elements of the same type and size.
* It is known for its high-performance and provides efficient storage and data operations as arrays grow in size.

## Python Vs Numpy

## NumPy is regularly applied :

* Data manipulation and analysis: for data cleaning, transformation and aggregation. The data processed through varied NumPy mathematical operations such as statistical analysis
* Scientific computing: NumPy handles advanced mathematical operations such as matrix multiplication, eigenvalue calculation and differential equations.
  Valuable in modeling, visualization, computationalprocessing and other scientific computing tasks.
* Machine learning: ML tasks are math-intensive, and ML libraries -- such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn -- use NumPy for mathematical computations to support ML algorithms and model training.
* Signal and image processing: Signals and images represented as data arrays, and NumPy can provide tools needed to perform important processing tasks

# PANDAS

* Open source library built on top of NumPy library.
* Python package that offers various data structures and operations for manipulating tabular data, time series and many types of data sets.
* Fast and it has high performance & productivity for users.
* Popular for importing, analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data
* Created by Wes McKinney in 2008
* Provides Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D) structures
## import pandas as pd

## PANDAS - Advantages

* Data from different resources can be loaded.
* Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN)
* Size mutability: columns can be inserted / deleted from DataFrame
* Data set merging and joining.
* Allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories efficiently
* Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
* Relevant data is very important in data science.
